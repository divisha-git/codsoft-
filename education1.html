    Education is an important tool which is very useful in everybody’s life.
     Education is what differentiates us from other living beings on earth. 
     It makes man the smartest creature on earth. It empowers humans and gets them ready to 
     face challenges of life efficiently. With that being said, education still remains a
      luxury and not a necessity in our country. Educational awareness needs to be spread 
      through the country to make education accessible. But, this remains incomplete without
       first analyzing the importance of education. Only when the people realize what significance it holds, 
       can they consider it a necessity for a good life. In this essay on Education, we will see
        the importance of education and how it is a doorway to success.</p></div>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the most significant tool in eliminating poverty and unemployment. 
            Moreover, it enhances the commercial scenario and benefits the &nbsp;&nbsp;country overall. So, the higher
             the level of education in a country, the better the chances of development are.
            In addition, this education also benefits an &nbsp;&nbsp;individual in various ways. It helps a person take a
             better and informed decision with the use of their knowledge. This increases the success rate
              of a &nbsp;&nbsp;person in life.Subsequently, education is also responsible for providing with an enhanced lifestyle. 
            It gives you career opportunities that can increase &nbsp;&nbsp;your quality of life.
            Similarly, education also helps in making a person independent. When one is educated enough,
             they won’t have to depend on anyone &nbsp;&nbsp;else for their livelihood. They will be self-sufficient
              to earn for themselves and lead a good life.

                    To say that education is your doorway to success would be an understatement.
                     It serves as the key which will unlock numerous doors that will lead to success.
                      This will, in turn, help you build a better life for yourself.
                    An educated person has a lot of job opportunities waiting for them on the
                     other side of the door. They can choose from a variety of options and not be
                      obligated to do something they dislike. Most importantly, education impacts 
                      our perception positively. It helps us choose the right path and look at things
                       from various viewpoints rather than just one.In conclusion, education makes you a
                        better person and teaches you various skills. It enhances your intellect and the
                         ability to make rational decisions. It enhances the individual growth of a person.</p></div>
